I've seen computers and the internet develop from times as early as [640kb ram and 5.25" flopp discs](https://olivrea.de/olivetti-m24-go330-z8001-cpu-board/),
to todays fibre cables delivering information in 4k resolution within the blink of an eye.

I like developing API based software, services, bots, ... in `php`, `python` and `node`.

Due to recent GDPR issues on self hosted bugtrackers, I decided to not anymore report any bugs outside of GitHub.
The way I am going to notify about an issue, even security related, adheres to the following principle:

1. You have [enabled issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) and if applicable, have [added a security policy](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository) to your projects GitHub repository: I will open an issue there.
2. There is a public email address available on your project's website or GitHub: I contact you via email.
3. If the above does not apply, I am going to open a public question regarding the issue on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [information security stackexchange](https://security.stackexchange.com/), or [super user stackexchange](https://superuser.com/).

I respect everybody as a person, your sensitive information, system integrity and the laws between us, please in return respect my data the same way ‚úåÔ∏è
